# React Portfolio Template

This is my portfolio where I show my skills, projects. Using React, Tailwindcss and
animation with Framer Motion without AI. This is a modern portfolio with respensive. I used
Toaster to make popup notification and Web3Forms to get and send recruitment
information to my personal email if the employer finds me suitable for them.
